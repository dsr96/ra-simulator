# A random-access channel simulator for cellular networks

This simulator has been implemented on Python and enables the evaluation of the performance of the random-access channel (RACH) for LTE/5G cellular networks.

The implementation is based on the 3GPP standard reference [1-4].

## Contributor
Developed by David Segura Ramos (PhD student in the field of cellular communication at University of MÃ¡laga, Spain)

## Features
- Contention-based random-access channel evaluation for LTE/5G
- Results are exported in csv format to allow post-processing
- By default, metrics are plotted in different figures

## Parameters
The following parameters from the 3GPP standard can be modified:
- PRACH Configuration Index
- Number of available preambles
- Maximum number of attemps for a device before declaring RA failure (preambleTransMax)
- RAR Window Size
- Backoff Indicator

## Metrics
- Blocking probability: probability that a device reaches the maximum number of transmission
  attempts (preambleTransMax) and is unable to complete an access process.
- Average number of preamble retransmissions: average number of preamble retransmissions 
 required to have a success access
- Access delay: time elapsed between the first preamble transmission and the reception of Msg2

## Prerequisites
The following Python libraries are required:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
